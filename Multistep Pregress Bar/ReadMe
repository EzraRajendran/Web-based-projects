## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd multistep-progress-bar
   ```

3. **Open the project**:
   You can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the progress bar in action:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

4. **Customize**:
   - Modify the number of steps or adjust the layout by editing the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
   - Add or remove steps by altering the structure in the HTML file and adjusting the corresponding JavaScript logic.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure for the progress bar and step content.
- `style.css`: Contains styles for the progress bar, steps, and layout.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for navigating between steps and updating the progress bar.

## How to Use

1. **Open the app**: Launch the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. **Navigate through steps**: Click on the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to move between steps.
3. **Progress Update**: Watch as the progress bar dynamically updates as you navigate through the steps.
4. **Final Step**: On reaching the final step, the progress bar will be fully filled.

## Customization

- **Adding/Removing Steps**: 
  - To add a step, duplicate an existing step's HTML section and increment the step number in the JavaScript.
  - To remove a step, delete the corresponding HTML and adjust the JavaScript accordingly.

- **Styling**:
  - You can change the colors, width, and animations of the progress bar and buttons by editing the `style.css` file.
  
## Future Improvements

- Add validation to each step to ensure data entry before moving to the next.
- Implement optional step skipping.
- Add dynamic loading indicators between steps.
- Integrate with form data submission.
